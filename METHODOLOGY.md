# WorkNet Architecture

## Introduction

WorkNet is a web-based freelancer marketplace designed for remote service outsourcing, built with a serverless-first approach. The platform connects clients who need remote work done with skilled freelancers, while providing comprehensive administrative oversight for platform moderation and quality control.

## Core Philosophy

### MVP-First Approach
WorkNet follows a Minimum Viable Product strategy, focusing on core functionality that delivers immediate value:
- Essential user registration and authentication
- Basic job posting and proposal system
- Simple messaging between parties
- Administrative moderation capabilities
- Review and rating system

This approach allows for rapid deployment and user feedback collection before adding complex features like payment processing or advanced notification systems.

### Serverless-First Architecture
The decision to use a serverless architecture stems from several key benefits:
1. **Cost Efficiency**: Pay only for actual usage, ideal for an MVP
2. **Scalability**: Automatic scaling without infrastructure management
3. **Developer Experience**: Focus on business logic rather than server management
4. **Deployment Simplicity**: Single platform deployment (Vercel)

## Technology Stack Rationale

### SvelteKit
Chosen for its:
- **Performance**: Compiled components with minimal runtime overhead
- **Developer Experience**: Intuitive syntax and excellent TypeScript support
- **Full-Stack Capabilities**: Built-in API routes and SSR
- **Bundle Size**: Smaller production builds compared to React/Vue
- **Modern Features**: Built-in routing, stores, and reactive programming

### Tailwind CSS
Selected for:
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Utility-first approach speeds up development
- **Consistency**: Design system constraints prevent UI inconsistencies
- **Customization**: Easy theming and component styling
- **Production Optimization**: Automatic purging of unused styles

### Prisma ORM
Implemented because:
- **Type Safety**: Generated TypeScript types from schema
- **Database Agnostic**: Easy migration between database providers
- **Developer Experience**: Intuitive query syntax and migrations
- **Serverless Optimization**: Connection pooling and edge compatibility

### Neon PostgreSQL
Chosen for:
- **Serverless Native**: Built for serverless environments
- **Branching**: Database branching for development workflows
- **Performance**: Optimized for cloud-first applications
- **Compatibility**: Full PostgreSQL compatibility

### Vercel Deployment
Selected because:
- **SvelteKit Integration**: First-class support for SvelteKit applications
- **Edge Functions**: Global performance optimization
- **Automatic Scaling**: No configuration required
- **Developer Experience**: Git-based deployments and preview environments

## Admin Role Architecture

### Security-First Design
The admin role follows a security-first approach:

1. **No Self-Registration**: Admins cannot create their own accounts, preventing unauthorized access
2. **Admin-Only Creation**: New admins can only be created by existing admins
3. **Role-Based Access Control**: Strict route guards based on user roles
4. **Audit Logging**: All admin actions are logged for accountability

### Admin Capabilities
Admins have comprehensive platform control:
- **User Management**: View, suspend, deactivate, and reinstate users
- **Content Moderation**: Flag inappropriate jobs, proposals, or messages
- **System Analytics**: Access to platform usage and performance metrics
- **Audit Trail**: View all administrative actions and their justifications

### Implementation Strategy
```typescript
// Example admin guard in hooks.server.ts
if (url.pathname.startsWith('/admin') && user?.role !== 'admin') {
  throw redirect(302, '/auth/login');
}
```

## Data Flow & Moderation Logic

### User Lifecycle Management
1. **Registration**: Users choose between freelancer or client roles
2. **Profile Creation**: Role-specific profile setup (skills for freelancers, company info for clients)
3. **Verification**: Email verification and profile completion
4. **Moderation**: Ongoing admin oversight of user activities

### Content Moderation Pipeline
1. **Automated Flagging**: Basic content filtering for inappropriate material
2. **User Reporting**: Community-driven reporting system
3. **Admin Review**: Manual review of flagged content
4. **Action Taking**: Warnings, content removal, or account suspension
5. **Appeal Process**: Users can appeal administrative decisions

### Suspension & Reinstatement Logic
```typescript
// Example moderation flow
async function suspendUser(adminId: string, userId: string, reason: string) {
  await prisma.user.update({
    where: { id: userId },
    data: { status: 'suspended' }
  });
  
  await prisma.adminLog.create({
    data: {
      adminId,
      actionType: 'USER_SUSPENDED',
      targetUserId: userId,
      reason
    }
  });
}
```

## Database Design Philosophy

### Normalized Structure
The database follows normalization principles while maintaining query performance:
- Separate tables for user roles to avoid null columns
- Junction tables for many-to-many relationships
- Audit logs for administrative transparency

### Status Management
Every major entity has a status field for lifecycle management:
- Users: active, suspended, deactivated
- Jobs: open, in_progress, completed, flagged
- Proposals: pending, accepted, rejected

### Extensibility Considerations
The schema is designed for future enhancements:
- JSON fields for flexible metadata storage
- Enum types for easy status additions
- Foreign key relationships that support complex queries

## MVP Tradeoffs & Decisions

### What's Included in MVP
- Basic user authentication and authorization
- Simple job posting and proposal system
- Text-based messaging system
- Review and rating functionality
- Administrative moderation tools

### What's Deferred
1. **Payment Processing**: Complex to implement securely, deferred to v2
2. **Escrow System**: Requires payment integration first
3. **Advanced Notifications**: Email/SMS notifications beyond basic functionality
4. **File Sharing**: Beyond simple portfolio links and attachments
5. **Advanced Search**: Full-text search and complex filtering
6. **Mobile Apps**: Web-first approach, mobile apps in future iterations

### Technical Debt Acceptance
- **Simple Auth**: Using basic sessions instead of JWT tokens initially

- Prisma for database type safety
- ESLint and Prettier for code consistency
- Vitest for unit and integration testing

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Session-based authentication with secure cookies
- Role-based access control throughout the application

### Data Protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention through Prisma
- XSS prevention through framework defaults
- CSRF protection for state-changing operations

### Admin Security
- Multi-factor authentication for admin accounts (future)
- IP whitelisting for admin access (future)
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Regular security reviews and updates

This serves as the foundation for building a scalable, secure, and user-friendly freelancer marketplace that can grow with business needs while maintaining code quality and security standards.
